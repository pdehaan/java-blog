My entire life I've tried to be fluent in another language and I've always failed. I never got passed introductory anything. Well, I learned there's a customer who comes regulary that speaks Spanish so I thought I'd give this language I was forced to learn in high school a shot. I hadn't touched it in 10 years so was shocked to learn [Speakly](https://www.speakly.me/) thought I was beginner advanced!

## Resources I'm using

This is a non-exhaustive incomplete list

### Language Courses

1. [Speakly](https://www.speakly.me/) (for transparency I am using the paid version)
2. [Language Transfer](https://www.languagetransfer.org/free-courses-1#complete-spanish) (I use the android app and it is free)
3. [Espanol Con Vicente](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuvOWBdv3vqahioA4C3fLyQ) (his channel is targeted more towards intermediate/advanced and I must admit most of what he says goes over my head but I guess it's a good way of measuring progress through comprehension over time).

### Youtube Channels
4. [Study With Alba](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_MQ1oL4JAnu3RQLJ4Cm_LA)
5. [Samual Gavilan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8hYE1gkw36-SW5eZsKRn-g)

### Blogs
1. [Miguel Angel Duran](https://midu.dev/) (fullstack web dev)

3. [Lenguajejs](https://lenguajejs.com/javascript/introduccion/que-es-javascript/) (intro to JS in Spanish)

The goal right now is to try to absorb as much vocabulary as possible. Language is 1 part input and 1 part output. I have multiple input channels but so far no output. Although I can some what comfortablily understand very basic songs and articles (think 1st grade level or maybe lower) I don't feel comfortable speaking or writing something as beginner friendly as an introduction (Hola! Mi llamo Rachel, tengo vientesies anos, vivo in Nueve York y soy de China. Trabaje como barista, ahora trabajo en el banco.).

I am currently on day 2 of learning Spanish. I try to do a minimum of 15 minutes a day. Surprisingly being consistent with language has also gotten me better at doing pushups todos los dias en la manana. Pero does dias es no bueno.

My biggest problem is that **I think in English**. I keep trying to use Spanish with English grammer. I'll try to check in again en una semana. Ciao ðŸ‘‹.
