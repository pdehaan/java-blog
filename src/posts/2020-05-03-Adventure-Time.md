I love Tumblr, I really do but I think I let the ease of producing stop me from moving forward. The community is fun and I still plan to stick around making themes here or there but it's finally time to branch out.

Right now I'm currently writing my posts in [Typora](https://typora.io/) in mark down  and man it's bringing me back to the days of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) which is actually pretty funny because this text editor supports [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).

Writing is actually fun! I know I post nonsense on Twitter and Tumblr but this blog let's me post learning nonsense in longform. I am excited to press on with learning front end and actually documenting my experience. The best part? I own the data on this here computer and can write OFF LINE!
