I'm going to attempt to explain math (this is funny because I suck at it ðŸ˜„).

### Propostion 

A **proposition** is a factual sentence that is either true or false but can't be both.
:::

This is very different from how we tend to use it in our day to day lives. A propisition (in logic) is *not* a suggested course of action or a type of belief. So "I have a proposition: let's buy 40 capybaras instead" is not a proposition and neither is "the proposition that every citizen deserves a free capyabara is absurd".

Here's a few examples of propositions:

* 3+3=6
* A capybara is not a country

Here are examples of statements that aren't propositions:

* Are capybaras edible?
* x+y=z

Can you explain why the first list are propositins and the second aren't?

A proposition variable is a letter that represents a propostion. For example: p could stand for "John is 29 years old". Common proposition variables are p, q, r, s, t and v. Stringing multiple propositions together creates a **compound proposition**.

Let's say p stands for "Ayisha owns two capybaras". How would you negate this? You could say "Ayisha does not own two capybaras". Using our variable p, it is _Â¬p_. **Â¬** is a negation sign. Slap it in front of any proposition and it will flip the meaning of the proposition.

### Conjuntion
A conjuntion is two statements together where both statements are true. The symbol is **^**. 

An example: She owns 40 capybaras and she also owns 30 llamas.

### Dysjunction âŠ•
A dysjunction is two statements where at least one of the statements is true. The symbol is **v**.

An example: She has 40 million dollars or she's a part of the mob
:::

There are two types of or, an **inclusive or** and an **exclusive or**. In an inclusive or, one of the statements must be true. In an exclusive or, only one statement can be true. 

Here's an example of an exclusive or: You can purchase a capybara or a dog but you cannot have both.

Here's an example of an inclusive or: Those who've successfully drank 70 shots of espresso or did 80 jumping jacks may recieve a free capybara.

To figure out whether a sentence is inclusive or exclusive, ask yourself "is it possible for both to be true?".

Let's take this ask: "Do you want a capybara or a vanilla latte?". If you respond "I want both" and the asker is ok with that than the ask was an inclusive or.
