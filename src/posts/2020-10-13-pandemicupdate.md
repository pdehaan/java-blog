## Normal?

I'm back at work (not surprsisingly). I started two months ago. My area seems like it's moved beyond the pandemic. Malls are open and so are farmers' markets (!!!). My local favorite coffee shop is back to slinging coffee and delicous pastries. And of course, people are starting to let their gaurds down with mask wearing. It's hard to image, just a few months ago I was at [home](https://smolnotes.netlify.app/posts/2020-04-30-reading/).

The key word is *seems*. Some of my friends and family are still jobless and just trying to keep their heads above water. Some got Covid and are working on healing themselves. Some are balancing parenting with working from home (eek!). 

I went to a wedding and it was really nice. I liked its small size, this made meeting new people so much easier. Apart from the masks and talks of politics, you wouldn't know we're living in strange times. 

Like many have stated, the Pandemic has revealed structural problems within the US that have always existed. I'm not sure if revealing inadiquacies are enough to actually move the nation forward. I don't think it is.

## On My Mind

Since this is my blog and I can talk about whatever I like: please feel free to watch this video.

I didn't watch the first Biden/Trump debate because I'm not a masochist. But I did watch Harris/Pence, and while I assume it was probably much more professional than Biden/Trump...it was still politicians doing what they do best, not answering questions.

The Kennedy/Nixon debate is how I imagine debates should be. A moderator asks questions and the presidential hopefuls answers them. Now the candidates didn't always answer the questions but when they chose not to, they often explained why. A truly unique feature of this debate that doesn't exist in debates today is the two listened to each other and held genuine conversation. They also made sure when they spoke to not veer to far from their domain of knowledge. They followed a lot of good advice that I just read about from Dale Carnegie's [public speaking book](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Quick_and_Easy_Way_to_Effective_Spea/qQaCDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover).

They both also quite saliently point out the difference between the two parties: one cares about taking care of the system as a whole, the other cares more about the individual. These two ways of looking at the world is right now being played out during Covid. The state I live in (on the whole) cares about the well being of the group. Measure were put in place to have the entire state quarentine for a short while. There's mask wearing rules and testing is pretty easy to get. My family in a different state does not have any of this. The responsibility for wearing a mask in this state is up to the individual.

The problems Kennedy and Nixon speak about are just as relevant today as they were in the 60's. Should goverments be subsidizing jobs, education and the enviroment? What of racial and economic inequalites? How does the nation handle an adverseary nation (China)?

In watching these debates and existing through Covid, I find myself beliveing less and less in America's ability to grow out of the indivdualist mindset.

## The Blog

On to more positive stuff!! I added a few more stuff in the Media page and am also thinking about adding a dark mode and maybe a section where I review tutorials. I still haven't found a way to add comments to the blog yet. But i will one day!

## Concluding Remarks

To pass on to the internet what my friend has passed on to me: take care of yourself and don't take anything for granted.
