I know I created a new post design only a few weeks ago only to change it again, but I had to try Tailwinds. 
I was very hesitant about using Tailwinds at first because it used inline CSS but thanks to kind Twitter users I 
read [this](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/) and [this article](https://frontstuff.io/in-defense-of-utility-first-css)
so had to at least give it a try. 

I basically used this video with a lot of google Windows stuff:

A major pitfall is [rm rf](https://superuser.com/questions/204406/whats-the-equivalent-to-rm-rf-with-windows-command)
is not the same for windows so you will need to switch it to `rmdir /s /q [directory]`. Also make sure you are using
the correct directories. For me, my output folder is _dis_ and my input is _src_. 

I realized the hard way also the difference between eleventy --start and npm run start.
