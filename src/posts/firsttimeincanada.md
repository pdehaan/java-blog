We are on the train and have been for eight hours s. Drove through Vermont for quite some time. It's kind of boring looking.

Customs were v intimidating and spoke French first. I def got the sign that they didn't want people staying in Canada too long. A good portion of the passengers could speak French. 

One passenger was coming for a 3+ month vacation. He was told next time to speak w immegrations. Another dude was scolded for not having traveler health insurance for Canada. Customs checked that guys return ticket to verify that he was going to leave at some point. He also has over 1milion$. I'm jelly.
Next time we're going by bus.
