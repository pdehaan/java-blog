# Accomplishments

This year I accomplished a few goals I set out for myself. Let's start with the small:

1. I finished one web course in its entirety (more accurately a subset of a course. It's FreeCodeCamp).
2. I read more books this year than I did last year! They are:
2. 1. Flatland by Edwin A Abbott
2. 2. Animorphs books by KA Applegate:
2. 2. 1. The Visser Chronicles
2. 2. 2. The Andalite Chronicles
2. 3. Wintersmith by Terry Practhett
2. 4. The Martian by Andy Weir
2. 5. The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking by Dale Carnegie
2. 6. Silence by Shusaku Endo
3. I made both a [portfolio](https://smolcodes.netlify.app/) and a personal website (it's this one!).
4. I am writing more! Maybe not once a week but absolutely a lot more. 
5. Learned to cook! Still not great but I am getting there

And the big goal is I switched jobs! I've had this job for 6 years so It's odd to leave. I'll write a longer post about my thoughts on this.

Here are goals I'd set out that I've not accomplished:

1. Reach b2 level in French (I'm still very much so A1).
2. Adding comments to this blog
3. Complete the free portion of CodeGym and DataQuest
4. Relearning discrete math
