>  To Love Another Person is to see the Face of God

Probably the first thing you ought to know about me is that Les Miserables is my favorite musical.

### About the Web Designer

I'm a coffee making web designer. I started learning in high school [with this book by Jennifer N. Robbings](https://www.learningwebdesign.com/). 
And with [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/). Back then, I used tables to create layouts. Wah~~. Some time around then I also attempted to make
DeviantArt journal skins but couldn't afford a premium account. Around the beginning of college, I got a Tumblr. That's when my front end interests really took
off. I [learned](https://buildthemes.tumblr.com/) how to make themes. The themes I've created have been used over 8,000 times!

I didn't start to seriously take front end web developement as a field I'd like to be a part of until this year! 

I recently learned [11ty](https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/) and am currently learning SASS as well as JavaScript and design systems. I'm also learning and have huge ineterest in accessibility.

### About the Coffee Drinker

Aside from web design, I'm a huge coffee fan and am technically [a coffee master](https://www.starbucks.co.th/coffeehouse/coffeemaster-program). But unfortunately 
and not really related am only an orange belt in [Washin Ryu Karate](http://www.hidyochiai.org/). Anyway, I prefer light roast coffee, especially ones that are 
fruity or nutty. The Chemex makes delicious coffee but I recommend you avid fabric filters and go for mesh if you're trying to reduce your carbon foot print.

I also like to say I'm going to run but never actually do it.. And sometimes I play video games, but only ones like Portal, Journey and Monument Valley because speed
and reflex are foreign concepts.

### Some Opinion

1. Websites should prioritize desktop over mobile
 1. Websites should prioritize function over form 
2. Accessibility is not just about the way a site looks or is navigatible but also if it is able to be accessed. A site that takes way too long to download is not acccessible.
3. Dark roast coffee is gross. Somewwhere between light and medium is best
4. No one is self made. We all got help from somewhere. Shout out to my astrnomy professor from Community College for making me realize STEM is pretty neat.
