## TL,DR 

> Consume more things that take a long time to engage with and write more.

## The Long way to verbose explanation

Since leaving College, I don't read or write nearly as much as I used to. And I've noticed my brain started to atrophy. In school, my head would be filled with ideas. I could make connections between disparate subjects. I felt more *alive*. I was also better at sustaining long term focus.

During the pandemic I decided to try to regain what I have lost. I've read more books than I have in the last few years*. I also played more video games. I say this because what I realized is the medium (books, games, movies) doesn't matter so much as the delivery. This is why simply reading any book isn't enough. Now before someone accuses me of being an elitest, let me explain what I mean.

We can agree that there's a difference between the game 2048 and Portal**. 2048 is very passive, It's something the back driver in your brain does to pass the time while waiting at the dentist. Portal requires your full attention. Books are the same way. Compare The Princess Diaries to Flatland. 

In College we'd be asked to write about what was being consumed: lab reports, essays etc. Being forced to write about what I just read made me engage with the text. Did I understand it? It also made me better at organizing my thoughts. *That's the bingo!*

Consuming alone isn't enough. I have to also create something to really add to what I'm enjoying. This is the ultimate goal of this site: <mark>to be a better writer by reading books, playing video games and watching movies that require time and effort</mark>.

## Site organization

I'm going to try to make a habit of trying to write every day...at the very least every week. This means that this site might have a lot of garbage. I'm going to try to separate the signal from the noise by organizing topics in tags so you don't have to read my BS.

You might ask: why publish on the Web? Why not keep a diary?
There's several reasons for this:

1. This site's files are in 2 places: Github and my laptop
2. I've noticed people don't really document the early parts of their learning journey. First post is: hey I'm learning HTML and then post 3 is: Why HAML is better than MarkDown***. Where's the in between steps?   
3. I wasn't a part of MySpace or LiveJournal. I have nostalgia for a history of the web I didn't experience: the [indie web](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/10/20/indieweb-talk/). Now that it's resurging I'm going to jump on the train before it disapears.
