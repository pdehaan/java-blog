Hey I'm Rachel and this is my playground to try new stuff so be warned, it will change its look and feel often.
I also like to use this site as a journal. I'm a firm advocate of having a [personal site](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/07/22/why-website/).
Whether it's a physical journal/diary or online version, it's important we have a place where we can put down our unfiltered thoughts so we can destress, reflect on what we've learned or just remember a good time. You don't need
to know any code whatsover to start your own site. With Squarespace, Wordpress and many prebuilt sites, it is easy to
get started! Personal sites for me are basically like digital houses.

Aside from screwing around with making this site, I also like to log the books I've read and movies I've watched 
as well as write about learning programming. And recently I've also been writing about life.
