## A Hot Mess of a Place

You're viewing my digital garden/sandbox of sorts. Be warned it will change and break often.

The first purpose of this place is to store my thoughts. Think of it as those post it notes stuck all over your house and office but in one place. I think it is important to have a part of the web where I don't need to be so polished. I can just be free to learn. This site has (probably mostly incomplete) thoughts on books I've read and whatever is clawing at my brain. The second purpose is to learn all things web developement. The best way to learn is to do. I need a place where I can break things. This is that place.
