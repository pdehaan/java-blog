## A Hot Mess of a Place

You're viewing my sandbox of sorts. Be warned it will change and break often.

The first purpose of this place is to store my thoughts. Think of it as those post it notes stuck all over your house and office but in one place. I house here pretty trendy things (thoughts on productivety, leadership, organization), not so trendy things (books I'm reading, languages I'm learning and superficial short opinions on songs) and whatever is in between (baddly cobbled together tutorials? adventures in cooking?). The second purpose is to learn all things web developement. The best way to learn is to do. I need a place where I can break things. This is that place.
